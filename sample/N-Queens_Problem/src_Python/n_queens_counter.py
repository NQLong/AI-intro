"""
N-Queens Placement and Solutions Counter
Author: James Walker
Copyrighted 2017 under the MIT license:
  http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

Purpose:
  The N-Queens Counter finds follows the same algorithm as the N-Queens
  Solver, except it does not return any of the solutions. Instead, the
  program counts the number of solutions for a given N-Queens problem as well
  as the number of times a queen is placed during the program's execution.
Example Usage:
  $ python ./n_queens_counter.py 12
  The 12-Queens problem required 428094 queen placements to find all 14200
  solutions

This implementation is based off the algorithm provided at the bottom of this
webpage: www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD316.9.html

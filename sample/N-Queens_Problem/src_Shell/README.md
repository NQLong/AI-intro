## _N_-Queens Solver and _N_-Queens Counter using Bash Shell Scripting  
There are two _N_-queens-related implementations, a problem solver and a solution counter. The _N_-Queens Solver, given a positive integer _N_, will output all of the valid solutions for the _N_-queens problem (execution details are provided below). The _N_-Queens Counter is similar to the _N_-Queens Solver, but instead finds valid solutions to the N-Queens problem and outputs a count of the number of solutions found for the given _N_ as well as the number of times a queen was placed on the chess board during the program's execution. On a side note, the _N_-Queens Counter executes much faster than the _N_-Queens Solver due to inlining most of the function calls   

Similar to the 8-queens solver in the `src_C` folder, each solution will consist of _N_ integers corresponding to the _N_ columns on the chess board, with each integer representing the row of the queen in the given column. In the example shown below, the numbers in the 8-queens solution `1 5 8 6 3 7 2 4` are sequentially ordered by column from A to H. Thus, queens are positioned on the chess board at `A1`, `B5`, `C8`, `D6`, `E3`, `F7`, `G2`, and `H4`.

**Required Tools:**  
- A terminal running Bash version 4+

**Executing the _N_-Queens Solver Program:**  
```  
$ cd 'C:/Users/SomeUser/Desktop'  
$ bash n_queens_solver.sh 6  
Solution 1:     2 4 6 1 3 5  
Solution 2:     3 6 2 5 1 4  
Solution 3:     4 1 5 2 6 3  
Solution 4:     5 3 1 6 4 2  
```  

**Executing the _N_-Queens Counter Program:**  
```  
$ cd 'C:/Users/SomeUser/Desktop'  
$ bash n_queens_counter.sh 6  
The 6-Queens problem required 152 queen placements  
to find all 4 solutions  
```

## _N_-Queens Solver and _N_-Queens Counter using the Go Programming Language  
There are two _N_-queens-related implementations, a problem solver and a 
solution counter. The _N_-Queens Solver, given a positive integer _N_, will 
output all of the valid solutions for the _N_-queens problem (execution details 
are provided below). The _N_-Queens Counter is similar to the 
_N_-Queens Solver, but instead finds valid solutions to the N-Queens problem 
and outputs a count of the number of solutions found for the given _N_ as well 
as the number of times a queen was placed on the chess board during the 
program's execution. On a side note, the _N_-Queens Counter executes much 
faster than the _N_-Queens Solver due to inlining most of the function calls.  

Similar to the 8-queens solver in the `src_C` folder, each solution will 
consist of _N_ integers corresponding to the _N_ columns on the chess board, 
with each integer representing the row of the queen in the given column. In the 
example shown below, the numbers in the 8-queens solution `1 5 8 6 3 7 2 4` are 
sequentially ordered by column from A to H. Thus, queens are positioned on the 
chess board at `A1`, `B5`, `C8`, `D6`, `E3`, `F7`, `G2`, and `H4`.

**Required Tools:**  
- [Go compiler]  

**Executing the _N_-Queens Program:**  
```  
$ cd 'C:/Users/SomeUser/Desktop'  
$ go build -o nqueens.exe  
$ ./nqueens.exe -h
Usage of C:/Users/SomeUser/Desktop/nqueens.exe:  
  -N int  
        The N-Queens problem to count solutions (default 4)  
  -type string  
        Options: counter, solver (default "counter")  
$ ./nqueens.exe -type solver  
2 4 1 3  
3 1 4 2  
$ ./nqueens.exe -N 6 -type solver  
2 4 6 1 3 5  
3 6 2 5 1 4  
4 1 5 2 6 3  
5 3 1 6 4 2  
$ ./nqueens.exe -type counter  
The 4-Queens problem required 16 queen placements to find all 2 solutions  
$ ./nqueens.exe -N 6 -type counter  
The 6-Queens problem required 152 queen placements to find all 4 solutions
